            <h1>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
          <p>Developers working in a “full-stack” capacity work on both frontend and backend development projects.

            Frontend development (or client-side development) projects include anything that users see includes websites and web applications that customers interact with (like the interface of an ecommerce web application).
            
          </p>
          <p> Backend development (or server-side development) projects include any behind-the-scenes part of a website or web app.As full-stack developers work on both frontend and backend projects, they need to use both frontend and backend programming languages and tools in their work.

            That includes languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for frontend development and programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby for backend development.</p>
